EPQ - Presentation


Use the below for a guide…

Your presentation should be between 10-15 minutes
Leave 5 minutes at the end for us to ask you questions (so whole thing 20 mins)
Your presentation is about the whole process of your project - not just the completed essay.
Try to make your presentation interesting - maybe use images/links/clips
 Try not to have lots of information on the slides - don’t be boring and just read out lots of information 
Think about how you are communicating - body language and speech
You need to include the following:
The project title and how you chose this subject/title - a summary of what your essay is about and your overall conclusions. 2-3 slides
How did you research your topic? Strengths/Weaknesses 1 slide

A reflection on your project and how you managed it
What have you learnt?
What skills have you developed?
How does this project fit in with your future goals/aims
What has gone well?
What has not gone well?
		These points should take up about 2-3 slides

What might you do differently next time? 1 slide

You must keep a copy of any slides/handouts used and put them together with the rest of your EPQ paperwork
