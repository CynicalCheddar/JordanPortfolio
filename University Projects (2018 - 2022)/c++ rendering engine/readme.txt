My submission for the 20-credit coursework computer graphics module at the University of Bristol's department of computer science.

It's a 3d rendering engine built from scratch in c++, using nothing but the base SDL2 library. 

The raytracing mode features multiple advanced rendering techniques:
Specular Lighting
Phong Shading
Soft Shadows
Reflective Materials
Environment Maps
Refractive Materials (glass) with the Frensel effect
Normal Mapping

I also rather like Star Trek
