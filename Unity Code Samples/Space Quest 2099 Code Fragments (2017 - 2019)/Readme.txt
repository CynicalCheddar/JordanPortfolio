A subset of scripts used in source code of Space Quest 2099.

This is because the full source code is damn near 25 GB, and it just wouldn't be fair on Github to upload everything.

Please see https://leversoftware.itch.io/space-quest-2099 for the full game

Full source is available on request, but only if you don't mind a fat old download.
